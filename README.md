# -Making-Business-Decisions-Based-on-Data-Project
The purpose of this project is to look for ways to boost revenue for an online store.For this sake I need to prioritize list of hypotheses (compiled with the help of Marketing department), launch an A/B test and analyze the results.
The project is divided into two parts: in the first the hypotheses are being prioritized with the help of two different frameworks, and the second part includes analysis of the chosen hypothesis.
